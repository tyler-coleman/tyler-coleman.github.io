                        You'll notice that I dont really have any specific label for who I am or what I do anywhere here, and the reason 
                        for that is simple: I don't really know. The only thing I've ever really wanted is something to consistently challenge me to 
                        grow, to learn, and to have fun in the process. With an open mind, I've learned that challenge can be found 
                        just about anywhere.

                        Despite finishing school with a degree in Electrical Engineering, I always found myself most drawn to classes that 
                        involved coding. I was a musician for a large portion of my life 
                        prior to college, and realizing that I no longer had the time to pursue music as before was one of the hardest 
                        things I had to come to terms with in school. Fortunately, I found coding to be just as creatively stimulating 
                        in its own way. Here's some stuff I've been working on recently.
                    </p>
                    <div class="Title">
                        <h3 class="Expandable" id="PedalLabel">digital guitar effects pedal</h3>
                    </div>
                    <div>(Teensy, embedded C)</div>
                    <div id="PedalContent" class="ExpandableContent" style="display: none">
                        <img src="assets/pedal.jpg" id="PedalPic" class="Right"/>
                        <p>
                            I was inspired to do this while working my way through a text on designing audio plugins in C++. The hardware here 
                            is pretty simple. An op-amp acting as a buffer biases the input signal from the guitar to 4.5V, then attenuates the 
                            signal to 3Vpk-pk before feeding it through an audio adapter to the line input of Cortex M4-based development board. 
                            The idea from here is simple - implement whatever DSP algorithms I want and upload the new code to yield whatever 
                            guitar effect my heart desires (and my brain can figure out). I'll never spend $200 on a boutique digital delay 
                            ever again.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            It's pretty ugly, I know.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            So far I've managed to implement a simple delay and some filters based on parameters set by potentiometers also 
                            being polled in real-time by the DSC. I hope to expand the pedal's capabilities in the future.

                            I've recently become very interested in front-end technologies like React. I took an online course diving pretty 
                            deep into its features as well as those of Redux, and wanted to build something to practice what I'd learned. 
                            Thus, I present Rate My Lunch - a faux social media where users post pictures of their lunch and assign ratings 
                            to others' posts. Right now it's really just my roommates (actually it's really just me), but I'm betting this 
                            thing is gonna blow up real quick.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Give it a try! I've included an option to login with preset credentials so you don't actually have to sign up 
                            for anything. It's a global feed and there isn't exactly any sort of filtering of the posted images so... you know, 
                            if you wanna upload something...
                        </p>

                            This one was built to serve as practice for React.js concepts/features as I was learning. The app itself is 
                            pretty straightforward - build a burger and order it. Previous orders are stored in a database and can be viewed
                            again after placed. There's some form validation and routing and other fun stuff going on. Check it out. Just 
                            don't use your real contact info.

                            This is an interactive desktop app written in C++ and utilizing the SDL graphics library. The program generates a 
                            fractal image representing the Mandelbrot set by implementing the escape-time algorithm. The program further 
                            implements histogram coloring based on customizable ranges set by the user in main. Each range corresponds to 
                            a subset of the histogram, and the colors at the start and end of the ranges are specified using a custom RGB 
                            struct. Pixels whose iteration number falls in between the start and end of the range are given a color that 
                            is a linear function of the difference between the start and end colors.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            To zoom in on a particular area, the user simply clicks the UI at the desired point. A zoom frame is added to an 
                            array maintained by the program, and the dimensions of the next frame are calculated before the zoomed image is 
                            re-rendered. To return to the last zoom frame, the user simply presses backspace. The max number of iterations 
                            executed before the program determines a point falls within the Mandelbrot set is customizable via a constant 
                            declared in Mandelbrot.h. Adjusting this constant trades off rendering speed for resolution.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Next, I hope to add elements to the GUI that will allow the user to customize the histogram coloring ranges and 
                            iterations per pixel without directly editing the source code. I also hope to optimize the drawing of the fractal 
                            by improving on the current implementation of the escape-time algorithm.
