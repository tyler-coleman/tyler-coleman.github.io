                <h2>Hello,</h2>
                <p>
                    My name is Tyler, and it seems that you've somehow stumbled your way upon my personal website. 
                    With time, I hope to grow this into a full-fledged, interactive experience that showcases everything 
                    I've worked on and enjoy. For now, well, I guess this is just a space for me to ramble about myself.
                </p>
                <p>
                        I grew up in the wee town of Cairo, Egypt after moving there with my family at 9 years old. Having 
                        been an army brat my whole life prior, moving around wasn't so much an ordeal as it was an inevitability. 
                        Nothing, however, could have prepared me for the sometimes awkward but always incredible experience that 
                        would be the next 9 years of my adolescent life.
                    </p>

                <p>
                    My decision to attend Tufts University in Boston following high school was a weird one, to say the least. 
                    My first Boston winter was about as much of a shock as one would expect for someone who spent their previous 
                    9 worried only about the occasional sandstorms and rain that came with winter in Egypt. In some ways, 
                    readjusting to life here was harder than acclimatizing to life on the other side of the planet ever was.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I graduated in 2017 with a B.S. in Electrical Engineering, and to be honest, I still don't know why I chose 
                    EE. When I sat down with my advisor about a month into my freshman year to pre-declare, I asked him which 
                    degree would prove most challenging and engaging over the course of my studies. His suggestion did not disappoint.
                </p>
                <h3>Some fun stuff about me:</h3>
                <strong><p>I'm a musician!</p></strong>
                <img src="assets/me.jpg" id="Right" />
                <p>
                    All my life I've been drawn to anything and everything music. From musicals to rock bands to acapella groups, 
                    music has always provided the greatest escape in my life. I even got to play the oud in my final year of college 
                    with the Arab Music Ensemble at Tufts.
                </p>
                <strong><p>I love to cook (and garden)!</p></strong>
                <p>
                    The one thing I missed most upon moving back to the U.S. was the food. Like, immediately missed it. So I reached out 
                    to all the moms and dads and friends back home I could think of and began amassing all the knowledge of Egyptian 
                    cuisine I could. And thus began a beautiful relationship with food, and cooking it in particular.   
                </p>
                <p>
                    For me, cooking provides a means of catharsis in a way that very few things can. It also provides the same sort of 
                    creatively engaging challenge as the most interesting of engineering problems. It pushes you to better yourself on 
                    every attempt - to reason your way through flavors and throroughly consider which cooking technique is best for 
                    whatever context. And the end result?
                </p>
                <p>Yum.</p>
                <strong><p>I'm working on my private pilot's license!</p></strong>
                <img src="assets/plane.JPG" id="Left" />
                <p>
                    I've wanted to be a pilot since before I left the womb. But my genes kinda suck, and it turns out they 
                    need you to have full color vision in order to fly commercially. Psh, what for?
                </p>
                <p>
                    A few months ago I took the plunge and booked my first ever flight with an instructor. The feeling of lifting off 
                    and being in control for the first time is something I'll never forget. I've spent the last few months regularly 
                    flying and am well on my way to my own license - they just won't let me fly at night!
                </p>
                <strong><p>Anways,</p></strong>
                <p>
                    You'll notice that I dont really have any sort of label for who I am or what I do anywhere here, and the reason 
                    for that is simple: I don't really know. I didn't get where I am today by obsessing over the details at every 
                    step of my life. Rather, the only thing I've ever really wanted is something to consistently challenge me to 
                    grow, to learn, and to have fun in the process. With an open mind, I've learned that challenge can be found 
                    just about anywhere.
                </p>
                <p>
                    And now I'm in California. Sorry for rambling.

                    Despite finishing school with a degree in Electrical Engineering, I always found myself most drawn to classes that 
                    involved coding - I guess it was something to do with the high that comes with watching your keystrokes turn into 
                    something cool right before your eyes in a matters of moments. I was a musician for a large portion of my life 
                    prior to college, and realizing that I no longer had the time to pursue music as before was one of the hardest 
                    things I had to come to terms with in school. Fortunately, I found coding to be just as creatively stimulating 
                    in its own way. Here's some stuff I've been working on recently.
                </p>
                <h3>Digital Guitar Effects Pedal</h3>
                <img src="assets/pedal.jpg" id="Right" />
                <p>
                    I was inspired to do this while working my way through a text on designing audio plugins in C++. The hardware here 
                    is pretty simple. An op-amp acting as a buffer biases the input signal from the guitar to 4.5V, then attenuates the 
                    signal to 3Vpk-pk before feeding it through an audio adapter to the line input of Cortex M4-based development board. 
                    The idea from here is simple - implement whatever DSP algorithms I want and upload the new code to yield whatever 
                    guitar effect my heart desires (and my brain can figure out). I'll never spend $200 on a boutique digital delay 
                    ever again.
                </p>
                <p>
                    It's pretty ugly, I know.
                </p>
                <p>
                    So far I've managed to implement a simple delay and some filters based on parameters set by potentiometers also 
                    being polled in real-time by the DSC. I hope to expand the pedal's capabilities in the future.
                </p>

                    I've recently become very interested in front-end technologies like React. I took an online course diving pretty 
                    deep into its features as well as those of Redux, and wanted to build something to practice what I'd learned. 
                    Thus, I present Rate My Lunch - a faux social media where users post pictures of their lunch and assign ratings 
                    to others' posts. Right now it's really just my roommates (actually it's really just me), but I'm betting this 
                    thing is gonna blow up real quick.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Give it a try! I've included an option to login with preset credentials so you don't actually have to sign up 
                    for anything. It's a global feed and there isn't exactly any sort of filtering of the posted images so... you know, 
                    if you wanna upload something...
                </p>
                <p>
                    Lunch pics only, please.
