                        My name is Tyler, and this is my personal website. 
                        With time, I hope to grow this into a full-fledged, interactive experience that showcases everything 
                        I've worked on and enjoy. For now, I guess this is just a space for me to ramble about myself.

                        I grew up in the wee town of Cairo, Egypt after moving there with my family at 9 years old. Having 
                        been an army brat my whole life prior, moving around wasn't so much an ordeal as it was an inevitability. 
                        Nothing, however, could have prepared me for the sometimes awkward but always incredible experience that 
                        would be the next 9 years of my life.
                    </p>

                        I attended Tufts University in Boston following high school. 
                        My first Boston winter was about as much of a shock as one would expect for someone who spent their previous 
                        9 worried only about the occasional sandstorms and rain that came with winter in Egypt. In some ways, 
                        readjusting to life here was harder than acclimatizing to life on the other side of the planet ever was.

                    <p>
                        I graduated in 2017 with a B.S. in Electrical Engineering, with cum laude honors. While in my program, 
                        I placed a strong emphasis on coding courses and project work. This led to me graduating with a very broad
                        set of technical skills, having written code for all sorts of projects ranging from embedded signal processing
                        systems to web applications to physical systems modeling with Python. 
                        I'm at my absolute happiest when learning and working with new technologies.

                            All my life I've been drawn to anything and everything music. From musicals to rock bands to acapella groups, 
                            music has always provided the greatest escape in my life. I even got to play the oud in my final year of college 
                            with the Arab Music Ensemble at Tufts.

                            The one thing I missed most upon moving back to the U.S. was the food. So I reached out 
                            to all the moms and dads and friends back home I could think of and began amassing all the knowledge of Egyptian 
                            cuisine I could. And thus began a beautiful relationship with food, and cooking it in particular.

                        <p>
                            For me, cooking provides a means of catharsis in a way that very few things can. It also provides a similar sort of 
                            creatively engaging challenge as the most interesting of engineering problems. It pushes you to better yourself on 
                            every attempt. And the end result?

                            I've wanted to be a pilot since I was a little kid. That dream got shot down pretty early when I learned 
                            they don't let colorblind folk fly commercial airplanes. Fair enough, I guess.

                            As it turns out, however, they'll still let you fly your own planes.
                            A few months ago I took the plunge and booked my first ever flight with an instructor. The feeling of lifting off 
                            and being in control for the first time is something I'll never forget. I've spent the last few months regularly 
                            flying and am well on my way to my own license - they just won't let me fly at night!

                        You'll notice that I dont really have any sort of label for who I am or what I do anywhere here, and the reason 
                        for that is simple: I don't really know. I didn't get where I am today by obsessing over the details at every 
                        step of my life. Rather, the only thing I've ever really wanted is something to consistently challenge me to 
                        grow, to learn, and to have fun in the process. With an open mind, I've learned that challenge can be found 
                        just about anywhere.

                        Despite finishing school with a degree in Electrical Engineering, I always found myself most drawn to classes that 
                        involved coding. I was a musician for a large portion of my life 
                        prior to college, and realizing that I no longer had the time to pursue music as before was one of the hardest 
                        things I had to come to terms with in school. Fortunately, I found coding to be just as creatively stimulating 
                        in its own way. Here's some stuff I've been working on recently.

                            I was inspired to do this while working my way through a text on designing audio plugins in C++. The hardware here 
                            is pretty simple. An op-amp acting as a buffer biases the input signal from the guitar to 4.5V, then attenuates the 
                            signal to 3Vpk-pk before feeding it through an audio adapter to the line input of Cortex M4-based development board. 
                            The idea from here is simple - implement whatever DSP algorithms I want and upload the new code to yield whatever 
                            guitar effect my heart desires (and my brain can figure out). I'll never spend $200 on a boutique digital delay 
                            ever again.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            It's pretty ugly, I know.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            So far I've managed to implement a simple delay and some filters based on parameters set by potentiometers also 
                            being polled in real-time by the DSC. I hope to expand the pedal's capabilities in the future.

                            I've recently become very interested in front-end technologies like React. I took an online course diving pretty 
                            deep into its features as well as those of Redux, and wanted to build something to practice what I'd learned. 
                            Thus, I present Rate My Lunch - a faux social media where users post pictures of their lunch and assign ratings 
                            to others' posts. Right now it's really just my roommates (actually it's really just me), but I'm betting this 
                            thing is gonna blow up real quick.

                            Give it a try! I've included an option to login with preset credentials so you don't actually have to sign up 
                            for anything. It's a global feed and there isn't exactly any sort of filtering of the posted images so... you know,

                            This one was built to serve as practice for React.js concepts/features as I was learning. The app itself is 
                            pretty straightforward - build a burger and order it. Previous orders are stored in a database and can be viewed
                            again after placed. There's some form validation and routing and other fun stuff going on. Check it out. Just

                            This is an interactive desktop app written in C++ and utilizing the SDL graphics library. The program generates a 
                            fractal image representing the Mandelbrot set by implementing the escape-time algorithm. The program further 
                            implements histogram coloring based on customizable ranges set by the user in main. Each range corresponds to 
                            a subset of the histogram, and the colors at the start and end of the ranges are specified using a custom RGB 
                            struct. Pixels whose iteration number falls in between the start and end of the range are given a color that 
                            is a linear function of the difference between the start and end colors.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            To zoom in on a particular area, the user simply clicks the UI at the desired point. A zoom frame is added to an 
                            array maintained by the program, and the dimensions of the next frame are calculated before the zoomed image is 
                            re-rendered. To return to the last zoom frame, the user simply presses backspace. The max number of iterations 
                            executed before the program determines a point falls within the Mandelbrot set is customizable via a constant 
                            declared in Mandelbrot.h. Adjusting this constant trades off rendering speed for resolution.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Next, I hope to add elements to the GUI that will allow the user to customize the histogram coloring ranges and 
                            iterations per pixel without directly editing the source code. I also hope to optimize the drawing of the fractal 
                            by improving on the current implementation of the escape-time algorithm.
